# Trinitys-MultiTool
My Custome IT MultiTool
Hi this is a project that is run by 1 person (me) this is not a fantastic project or the best by any means but it works for me and I thought others in IT.
Workspace would appreciate so please enjoy :) 


The file is 400b which requires me to post it to a MEGA link so you can
download it which sucks for me bc it lowers ur guys' trust but I will still upload
the source of the file like the base version missing most of the quality features
like no Brave, discord and QbitTorrent but if you still would like the full version (which if I were you I would) make
sure to just download the full tool I'm also sure I'll update it more frequently
The full tools Mega link will be in the Main Tree of files and I  will make a txt with the link !
